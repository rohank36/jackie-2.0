# jackie-2.0
Fine tuned a model to do the NYT crosswords, named after the fastest player in my crossword league.


10/4/2024:

 
GPT: 6/10 --> 60% accuracy

Jackie 2.0: 2/10 --> 20% accuracy


Still a lot to learn. Currently doing the FastAI: Deep Learning For Coders course. Will come back to this project at the end of the summer and improve jackie-2.0 to beat Chat GPT 4 and achieve >90% accuracy.
